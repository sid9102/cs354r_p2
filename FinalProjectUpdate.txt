Final Project Update

We were able to deliver on everything that was promised in the design document.  We were able to
complete network communication between the server and client computers fairly early on, which helped
us dedicate time to some unforseen bugs in UI creation that causes us problems at late stages of the
project.  Unlike before, time was not as much of a problem as it was , allowing us to work more leisurely,
but also not attempting to add more features not outlined in the design document in order to keep
our time advantage.
